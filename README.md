# chatbot

This is a simple Stack Exchange chatbot in C.  

It currently doesn't do much useful, but it is able to connect to a chat room, listen to messages, interperet commands, post messages, and reply to messages.

Once it's done, it will monitor new/edited posts for ones that match filters for low-quality posts.
